Classes should not depend on each other directly. 

So reducing coupling between classes by intrucing abstractions (think of interfaces) between them.

This principle could be rephrased as use the same level of abstraction at a given level. Interfaces should depend on other interfaces. 
Don’t add concrete classes to method signatures of an interface.
